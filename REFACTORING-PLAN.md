# Boilerplate-01 Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the refactoring plan to improve the codebase structure, eliminate redundancy, and enhance maintainability for the boilerplate-01 project.

## MongoDB URI Utilities Duplication

- [x] **Consolidate URI handling functions**
  - [x] Keep the comprehensive implementation in `src/utils/mongodb-uri.ts`
  - [x] Remove duplicate `normalizeMongoURI` from `src/lib/db/mongodb.ts`
  - [x] Remove duplicate `normalizeMongoUri` from `src/lib/db/check-env.ts`
  - [x] Update imports to use the centralized utility

## Database Connection Management

- [x] **Consolidate connection logic**
  - [x] Ensure `simplified-connection.ts` is the primary connection mechanism
  - [x] Update `mongodb.ts` to use the simplified connection or document its specific purpose
  - [x] Document when to use each approach if both are still needed

## Clean Up Empty/Unused Files

- [x] **Remove empty and unused files**
  - [x] Delete empty `connection-manager.ts` file (currently empty but still present)
  - [x] Search for any remaining imports of `connection-manager.ts` and update them

## Environment Variable Handling

- [x] **Create unified environment configuration**
  - [x] Create a centralized environment setup in `src/config/environment.ts`
  - [x] Merge functionality from `check-env.ts` and `env-debug.ts`
  - [x] Replace inline environment checks with centralized imports

## Logger Implementation

- [x] **Create unified logger service**
  - [x] Create `src/lib/logger.ts` with a standard Logger interface
  - [x] Move ConsoleLogger from `index.ts` to this file
  - [x] Integrate with monitoring functionality
  - [x] Update all console.log/error calls to use the logger

## File Structure Improvements

- [x] **Reorganize file structure**
  - [x] Move database configuration to `src/config/database/`
  - [x] Create `src/lib/db/utils/` for database utilities
  - [x] Clearly separate configuration from implementation logic

## Specific File Changes

- [x] **MongoDB URI Utils**
  - [x] Update `src/utils/mongodb-uri.ts` to be the definitive source
  - [x] Add any missing functionality from the duplicate implementations

- [x] **Environment Configuration**
  - [x] Create `src/config/environment.ts` as the centralized environment config
  - [x] Document all required environment variables and default values
  - [x] Implement validation for required environment variables

- [x] **Connection Module**
  - [x] Update `src/lib/db/index.ts` to use simplified connections only
  - [x] Document the connection approach in the file header

## Additional Improvements

- [ ] **Type Safety**
  - [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all database operations
  - [ ] Ensure consistent error handling across database operations

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Add clear documentation for the database module
  - [ ] Document the preferred approach for database connections
  - [ ] Add inline documentation for complex functions
